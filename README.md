# Prediction of Grocery Store Sales

This project is completed in October 2021.
The notebook can be summarized as follows :

•	Exploratory Data Analysis was performed for the train, store and test dataset. It includes finding null values, replacement of null values, visualization of the presence of null values.

•	Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regressor are used for train the model.

•	Feature Engineering is implemented to determine the significant features and use them to train the model.

•	Randomized search CV is used for the hyperparameter tuning of random forest regressor.

•	SHAP is implemented for the interpretability of the predictions.
